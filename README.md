Have used R tool
###
Here we are analyzing the flight delay of two flights RegionEx’s flights and  MDA’s flights to 
understand weather the flight delay ranking tell us the correct story.
###
Have Computed the mean, median, 90th percentile,
and standard deviation of the number of arrival delay minutes of RegionEx’s flights and  MDA’s flights.
###
Have Inspected the distribution of RegionEx’s arrival delays by constructing a histogram of the number 
of arrival delay minutes of RegionEx’s flights and MDA’s flights.
###
Using the FAA definition of a “late” flight, have calculated what percentage of RegionEx’s September flights were “late” , 
What percentage of MDA’s September flights were “late” and 
What percentage were “on‐time” for each airline, according to the FAA definition.
###
Have Compared the performance of the two airlines on each flight leg by calculating the descriptive statistics
(mean, median, 90th percentile, standard deviation)
of delay minutes for each of the four routes. Calculated the % delay flights for each of the route.
###
Compared the scheduled flight durations for the two airlines on each of their four routes.
